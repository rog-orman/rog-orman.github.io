          <h2>The 2022/23 Robot</h2>
          <p>My team and I designed and built a competitive robot with advanced mechanisms to compete in the First Tech
            Challenge's Power Play, a robotics tournament for middle and highschoolers. A bird's eye view of the
            robot is depicted to the right.</p>

          <h2>Robot Intake/Output</h2>
          <p>A dual intake system was created in order to transport cones with a higher efficiency in the autonomous
            period. The intake linear slides and claw in the prototyping stage are depicted to the left. This system is
            furthur elaborated upon below.</p>

          <h2>Robot Subsystem - Linear Slides</h2>
          <p>Linear slides: These were used as the main dynamic component for the intake (driven by a scissor mechanism)
            and output (driven by a spool) and can be seen in full extension to the right.</p>

          <h2>Robot Subsystem - Auto to Tele-op Conversion</h2>
          <p>Turret and Linear Actuator: This subsystem was a feature original to only our robot. A main rationale for focusing on this conversion mechanism was that the highest scoring autonomous robots were designed for expansion but were difficult to manually control, and the highest scoring teleop robots were designed for maneuverability but struggled with precoded consitency. The turrent and linear acuator was our way of combining both of these ideas without their disadvantages. Specializing functionality mid-round for either maximum software efficiency or ease of manual control proved to be the right choice, as we were able to outscore multiple robots by ourselves. <br><br>To elaborate on the mechanics of our idea, the
            autonomous period could utilize the full extension of its horizontal linear slides as well as a set of angled vertical linear slides to reduce errors coming from full body movement. However, during the teleop period, these extensions could interfer with driver controlability. Thus, at the end of the autonomous period, the horizontal slides would retract, and the turret mounted linear actuator would move the upright linear slides into a perfectly vertical position. Simultanously, the turrent would reorient the slides and output claw so they could be facing outwards, acting like a forklift. These adjustments made it so that the drivers only had to worry about up, down, and grabing controls for attachments, allowing for more control in a time pressured enviorment. The parts foundational to this mechanism are depicted directly to the left and behind the black wires, and this mechanism in action can be seen at the end of the video in the software development section.</p>

          <h2>Robot Subsystem - Claws and Drivetrain</h2>
          <p>Output Claw: This two-axial claw can be seen above reaching towards the viewer. The two axies increased mobility for the autonomous period depicted in the software section.<br><br>Intake Claw: This claw (seen to the right) was attached to servos and lever arms
            to again create an increased range of motion able to flip the cone for an effiecent transfer between claws.
            This claw was only utilized in autonomous as we found that during the teleop period it was much easier to
            only use the output subsystem.<br><br> Drive train: The drive train used was a fairly simple mechanum drive
            train allowing sideways and diagonal movements. The drive train was also equipped with 3D-printed wheel
            guards for increased durability and on-field error prevention. </p>

          <h2>Software Development</h2>
          <p>We implemented autonomous and tele-op control using Java. For autonomous various ideas were implemented,
            including that of using a finite-state machine and threading for multitasking, as well as using Open CV for
            color image recognition. Spline pathing was also experimented with but was eventually determined to be
            unoptimal after calibration and further testing. Our 30 second autonomous period can been seen in the video to the left.</p>

          <h2>Team Collaboration</h2>
          <p>Effective teamwork and strategic planning helped us excel in competitions and outreach programs. A main
            proponent of our success was the driver-controlled tele-op, where immediate communication and strategy
            between the coach (myself) and the drivers was vital.</p>
